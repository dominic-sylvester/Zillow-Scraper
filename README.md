# Zillow-Scraper 
(Specific For NY Schenectady)

Created by Sanjay Sewbhajan

Utilized scrapy to scrap Zillow for listings of houses in specific area codes of Schenectady, NY. The code utilized rotating proxies to grab additional data. The requests were not heavy so did not harm website.

Project was originally for comparing pricing of houses over time for a potential buy as the area is upcoming.

Next Steps:
+ Change to GUI or a CLI your easier use.
+ Switch to a broader search range but limit amount of scraping (do not want to harm website)
