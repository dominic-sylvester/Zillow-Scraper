# zillowspiderman

Program is able to scrape Zillow using scrapy and rotating proxies 

Tried my best to format the data to a csv file. The data has a few bugs since I coded by expecting where it would be rather than coding from the actual data.

Will try to continue to updating bot.
Not too familiar with the mechanics of github so I dont know how to commit changes all the time.
